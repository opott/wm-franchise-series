Hello, and welcome to the first video in my three-part series on rail operators in the West Midlands. Today, we will be looking at the first privatised operator, Central Trains.

Following on from the privatisation of British Rail, the contract for the Central Trains franchise was awarded to National Express, who ran the franchise under the brand of Central Trains from 2nd March 1997. 

At their greatest extent, they operated 253 stations and covered 1534 miles of the UK rail network.

The company ran several regional, long-distance & Network West Midlands services.

Regional services included:
-   Birmingham New Street – Nottingham via Leicester
-   Birmingham New Street – Nottingham via Derby
-   Birmingham New Street – Mid Wales and Chester
-   Northampton – Crewe
-   Coventry – Lincoln Central via Nuneaton
-   Nuneaton – Coventry 
-   Nottingham – Skegness
-   Doncaster / Lincoln Central – Peterborough via Spalding
-   Newark North Gate – Lincoln – Cleethorpes
-   Leicester – Lincoln Central
-   Derby – Crewe / Nottingham / Matlock
-   Nottingham – Mansfield Woodhouse / Worksop

Long-distance services included:
-   Birmingham New Street – Liverpool Lime Street
-   Birmingham New Street – Stansted Airport
-   Cardiff Central – Birmingham New Street – Nottingham 
-   Liverpool Lime Street – Nottingham – Norwich

Network West Midlands services included:
-   Coventry – Birmingham New Street – Wolverhampton
-   Redditch/Longbridge – Four Oaks/Lichfield Trent Valley
-   Great Malvern/Worcester/Kidderminster – Dorridge/Shirley/Stratford-upon-Avon
-   Birmingham – Walsall / Stafford
-   Walsall – Wellington via Wolverhampton
-   Worcester – Birmingham New Street

Central Trains inherited a large fleet of trains, which consisted:
-   38 Class 150 Sprinters
-   21 Class 153 Super Sprinters
-   20 Class 156 Super Sprinters
-   36 Class 158 Express Sprinters
-   10 Class 310
-   4 Class 312
-   26 the Class 323

The Class 310 & 312 had already been withdrawn at the time of privatisation, being replaced by the newly built Class 323 on the Cross City Line. They remained with Central Trains as backup trains.

Not long after the franchise was awarded to National Express, a total of 33 new Turbostar trains were ordered, with the intent to replace older rolling stock. Over the course of the franchise, many Class 156 & 158 units were transferred to other operators, including Wales & Borders, and National Express East Anglia. Central Trains also acquired additional Turbostar trains that were no longer required by Midland Mainline.

The Strategic Rail Authority decided to divert rolling stock originally intended for South West Trains to Central Trains. This saw the company benefit from 30 Class 350 units, which they shared with Silverlink for use on the West Coast Mainline.

In the late 90s, Central Trains decided to merge separate, shorter routes into single, longer routes and displayed these in their timetables. This created a direct, long-distance travel option, which reduced the need for as many train changes. As a result, routes became significantly longer. A notable example is the service from Aberystwyth in Wales to Grimsby, on the opposite coast of the UK. There were also direct services from Birmingham to Stansted Airport.

In 2001, services west of Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth, Pwllheli and Chester were transferred away to form the new Wales & Borders franchise. Central Trains transferred 11 of their Class 158 Super Sprinters to the new operator.

In 2003, Central Trains began using the Central Citylink brand name to differentiate their long-distance and regional express offerings from their local services. There was no dedicated fleet for these services, however, they were usually operated by the more modern Class 170 and Class 158 units. 

2004 & 2005 saw significant changes for Central Trains, as they prepared themselves for the eventual breakup of the franchise. 

Services from Leamington Spa to Birmingham and Stratford were transferred to Chiltern Railways, however, they still maintained a peak-hour service to and from Leamington Spa. The service frequency between Birmingham and Stourbridge was increased to every 10 minutes, which resulted in an increase in service to Kidderminster. As part of the new Stourbridge line timetable, all remaining New Street trains were diverted to Snow Hill. Liverpool to Stansted Airport services started to split at New Street to form two separate services. The Birmingham to Nottingham via Leicester & Derby service was split, and the Leicester to Nottingham service was merged with the hourly Ivanhoe Line service to Loughborough and was extended past Nottingham to Lincoln.

Trent Valley local services that ran between Stafford and Nuneaton were discontinued due to a lack of drivers. They were not restored until over a year later when they were replaced by electric services from Northampton to Crewe. The Birmingham to Stafford via Walsall services were also affected by the driver shortage and were cut back to run between Birmingham & Rugeley, as they do today.

When Central Trains gained the Birmingham to Northampton route from their sister company, Silverlink, they discontinued their single daily Northampton service, which ran to Nottingham via Birmingham. The two trains per hour that ran between Birmingham and London Euston were replaced by one train per hour to Northampton, which connected badly with onward services to London. The Northampton service started as an hourly express service, until it was merged with the local Coventry service, making journeys longer.

After engineering work at Nuneaton made it impossible for trains from Coventry to join the line towards Leicester, Central Trains discontinued their Coventry to Nottingham services. The service was later restored in 2005 as an hourly shuttle service to Nuneaton, requiring passengers to change multiple times to get to Nottingham.

The service between Coventry & Wolverhampton was split at Birmingham as Central Trains started to operate Class 321s. Some trains them ran Express from New Street to Birmingham International, stopping only at Marston Green, then all stations to Coventry. Services to Walsall were extended to International, calling at all stations.

In October 2004, the Department for Transport announced their plan to simplify rail franchises, including the withdrawal of the Central Trains franchise. It was decided that the franchise would terminate in April 2007, however this was later extended to November 2007.

On the 11th November 2007, Central Trains ceased operations, and its services transferred to other operators.
The Liverpool – Nottingham – Norwich service and local trains in the East Midlands were combined with Midland Mainline services to establish East Midlands Trains. 
The Cardiff – Birmingham – Nottingham and Birmingham – Stansted Airport Citylink services were integrated with former Virgin CrossCountry services to create CrossCountry. 
Additionally, local and urban services around the West Midlands were merged with former Silverlink Country services to form London Midland, which we will explore in the next video.
