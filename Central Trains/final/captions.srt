00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:02,791
Hello and welcome to the first video in

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:05,351
my three-part series on rail operators in

3
00:00:05,351 --> 00:00:07,871
the West Midlands. Today we will be

4
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:10,511
looking at the first privatised operator,

5
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:11,871
Central Trains.

6
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:14,985
Following the privatisation of British

7
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:17,185
Rail, the contract for the Central Trains

8
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,945
franchise was awarded to National

9
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,345
Express, who ran the franchise under the

10
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:22,985
brand of Central Trains from March

11
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:24,385
 2nd 1997.

12
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:26,626
At their greatest extent, they

13
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,626
operated 253 stations and covered

14
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:32,226
 1534 miles of the UK

15
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:33,306
rail network.

16
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:36,221
The company ran several regional,

17
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,821
long-distance and Network West Midlands

18
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:39,541
services.

19
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:44,552
Central train served key stations

20
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:46,632
including Birmingham, New Street,

21
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:48,792
Nottingham, Liverpool Lime Street,

22
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:51,312
Stansted Airport, Cardiff Central,

23
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:54,232
Norwich, Wolverhampton and Leicester just

24
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:54,952
to name a few.

25
00:00:57,156 --> 00:01:00,116
Central Trains inherited a large fleet of

26
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,356
trains which consisted of:

27
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,916
 38 Class 150 Sprinters,

28
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:07,916
21 Class, 153  Super Sprinters

29
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:10,636
, 20 Class 156 Super Sprinters

30
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,196
, 36 Class 158 Express

31
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:16,156
Sprinters, 10 Class 310s, four

32
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:18,836
Class 312s, and 26 Class 323s

33
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:20,436
.

34
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,810
The Class 310 and 312 had already

35
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,090
been withdrawn at the time

36
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,530
of privatisation, being replaced by the

37
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,410
newly built Class 323 on the Cross City

38
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,370
line. They remained with Central Trains

39
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,850
as backup trains.

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,420
Not long after the franchise was awarded

41
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,220
to National Express, a total of 33

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,660
new Turbostar trains were ordered, with

43
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,740
the intent to replace older rolling

44
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,260
stock. Over the course of the franchise,

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,060
many Class 156 and 158

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,660
units were transferred to other

47
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,380
operators, including Wales & Borders

48
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,420
and National Express East Anglia. Central

49
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,380
Trains also acquired additional Turbostar

50
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,700
trains that were no longer required by

51
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,860
Midland Mainline.

52
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,170
The Strategic Rail Authority decided to

53
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,850
divert rolling stock originally intended

54
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,330
for South West Trains to Central Trains.

55
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,730
This saw the company benefit from thirty

56
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,650
Class 350 units which they shared

57
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,010
with Silverlink for use on the West Coast

58
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,690
Main Line.

59
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,594
In the late 90s, Central Trains decided

60
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,914
to merge separate shorter routes into

61
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,634
single longer routes and displayed these

62
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,954
in their timetables. This created a

63
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,954
direct long distance travel option which

64
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:38,834
reduced the need for as many train

65
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:41,674
changes. As a result, routes

66
00:02:41,674 --> 00:02:44,674
became significantly longer. A notable

67
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:47,154
example is the service from Aberystwyth

68
00:02:47,154 --> 00:02:49,794
in Wales to Grimsby on the opposite

69
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,554
coast of the UK. There were also direct

70
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,234
services from. Ham to Stansted

71
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:55,994
Airport.

72
00:02:57,362 --> 00:03:00,362
In 2001, services West of Shrewsbury

73
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:03,282
to Aberystwyth,  and Chester were

74
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,682
transferred away to form the new Wales &

75
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:08,282
Borders franchise. Central Trains

76
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:11,042
transferred 11 of their Class 158s

77
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:12,762
to the new operator.

78
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:16,687
In 2003, Central Trains began

79
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,887
using the Central Citylink brand name to

80
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,127
differentiate their long-distance

81
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:22,407
distance and regional express offerings

82
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:24,687
from their local services. There was no

83
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,567
dedicated fleet for these services,

84
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,887
however, they were usually operated by

85
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,567
the more modern Class 170 and Class

86
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,047
 158 units.

87
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:37,175
2004 and 2005 saw

88
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,095
significant changes for Central Trains as

89
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,055
they prepared themselves for the eventual

90
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,615
breakup of the franchise.

91
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,875
Services from Leamington Spa to

92
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,075
Birmingham and Stratford were transferred

93
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,715
to Chiltern Railways, however they still

94
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,755
maintained a peak-hour service to and

95
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,795
from Leamington Spa. The service

96
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:57,475
frequency between Birmingham and

97
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:59,835
Stourbridge was increased to every 10

98
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:02,635
minutes, which resulted in an increase in

99
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:05,075
service to Kidderminster. As part of the

100
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,795
new Stourbridge Line timetable, all

101
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:09,995
remaining New Street trains were diverted

102
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:12,715
to Snow Hill. Liverpool to Stansted

103
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:15,475
Airport services started to split at New

104
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:18,115
Street to form 2 separate services. T

105
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:20,715
he Birmingham to Nottingham via Leicester

106
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:22,915
and Derby service was split and the

107
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:24,515
Leicester to Nottingham service was

108
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,475
merged with the hourly Ivanhoe Line

109
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,595
service to Loughborough and was extended

110
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:29,995
past Nottingham to Lincoln.

111
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:33,462
Trent Valley local services that ran

112
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:35,542
between Stafford and Nuneaton were

113
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,022
discontinued due to a lack of drivers.

114
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:40,542
They were not restored until over a year

115
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,982
later when they were replaced by electric

116
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,742
servicesfrom Northampton to Crewe. The

117
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:47,862
Birmingham to Stafford via Walsall

118
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,182
services were also affected by the driver

119
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:52,502
shortage and were cut back to run between

120
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,982
Birmingham and Rugeley as they do

121
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:55,622
today.

122
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:58,915
When Central Trains gained the Birmingham

123
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:00,755
to Northampton route from their sister

124
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:03,355
company Silverlink, they discontinued

125
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:05,515
their single daily Northampton service

126
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:07,995
which ran to Nottingham via Birmingham.

127
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,355
The two trains per hour that ran between

128
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:12,315
Birmingham and London Euston were

129
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,115
replaced by 1 train per hour to

130
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,595
Northampton, which connected badly with

131
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,595
onward services to London. The

132
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:21,115
Northampton service started as an hourly

133
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,835
express service until it was merged with

134
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:26,155
the local Coventry service making

135
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:27,035
journeys longer.

136
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,195
After engineering work at Nuneaton made

137
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:32,315
it impossible for trains from Coventry to

138
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,715
join the line towards Leicester, Central

139
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:36,755
Trains discontinued their Coventry to

140
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:39,035
Nottingham services. The service was

141
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:41,995
later restored in 2005 as an hourly

142
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:44,515
shuttle service to Nuneaton, requiring

143
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,795
passengers to change multiple times to

144
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:47,675
get to Nottingham.

145
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,419
The service between Coventry and

146
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,219
Wolverhampton was split at Birmingham as

147
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,539
Central Trains started to operate Class

148
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,299
 321s. Some trains then ran

149
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:00,459
express from New Street to Birmingham

150
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:03,019
International, stopping only at Marston

151
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,659
Green, then all stations to Coventry.

152
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:08,539
Services to Walsall were extended to

153
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,779
International, calling at all

154
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,659
stations.

155
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,269
In October 2004, the Department for

156
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:17,149
Transport announced their plan to

157
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:19,989
simplify rail franchisesincluding the

158
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:21,669
withdrawal of the Central Trains

159
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,069
franchise. It was decided that the

160
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,069
franchise would terminate in April

161
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,909
 2007, however, this was later

162
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,229
extended to November 2007.

163
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,320
On November 11th, 2007,

164
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Central Trains ceased operations and its

165
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,760
services transferred to other operators.

166
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,040
The Liverpool to Nottingham to Norwich

167
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,160
service and local trains in the East

168
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,000
Midlands were combined with Midland

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,400
Mainline services to establish East

170
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,520
Midlands Trains. The Cardiff to

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,960
Birmingham to Nottingham and Birmingham

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,560
to Stansted Airport Citylink services

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,320
were integrated with former Virgin

174
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,160
CrossCountry services to create

175
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,040
CrossCountry. Additionally, local and

176
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
urban services around the West Midlands

177
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,800
were merged with former Silverlink C

178
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,240
ountry services to form London Midland,

179
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,680
who we will explore in the next video.

180
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,734
That concludes everything for today's

181
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,694
video. If you did enjoy this video, I

182
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:19,734
would always appreciate a like and

00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:22,734
subscribe. Thanks for watching and I will

184
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,934
see you next time.
