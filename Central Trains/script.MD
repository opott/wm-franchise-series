Following on from the privatisation of British Rail, the contract for the Central Trains franchise was awarded to National Express, who ran the franchise under the brand of Central Trains from 2nd March 1997. 

At their greatest extent, they operated 253 stations and covered 1534 miles of the UK rail network.

The company ran several regional, long-distance & Network West Midlands services.

Regional services included:
-	Birmingham New Street – Nottingham via Leicester
-	Birmingham New Street – Nottingham via Derby

-	Nuneaton – Coventry

Network West Midlands services included:
-	Coventry – Birmingham New Street – Wolverhampton

Central Trains inherited a large fleet of trains, which consisted:
-	38 Class 150 Sprinters
-	21 Class 153 Super Sprinters
-	20 Class 156 Super Sprinters
-	36 Class 158 Express Sprinters
-	10 Class 310
-	4 Class 312
-	26 the Class 323

The Class 310 & 312 had already been withdrawn at the time of privatisation, being replaced by the newly built Class 323 on the Cross City Line. They remained with Central Trains as backup trains.

In the late 90s, Central Trains decided to merge separate, shorter routes into single, longer routes and displayed these in their timetables. This created a direct, long-distance travel option, which reduced the need for as many train changes. As a result, routes became significantly longer. A notable example is the service from Aberystwyth in Wales to Grimsby, on the opposite coast of the UK. There were also direct services from Birmingham to Stansted Airport.

In 2001, services west of Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth, Pwllheli and Chester were transferred away to form the new Wales & Borders franchise. Central Trains transferred 11 of their Class 158 Super Sprinters to the new operator.

In 2003, Central Trains began using the Central Citylink brand name to differentiate their long-distance and regional express offerings from their local services. There was no dedicated fleet for these services, however, they were usually operated by the more modern Class 170 and Class 158 units. 

2004 & 2005 saw significant changes for Central Trains, as they prepared themselves for the eventual break up of the franchise. 

Services from Leamington Spa to Birmingham and Stratford were transferred to Chiltern Railways, however, they still maintained a peak-hour service to and from Leamington Spa. The service frequency between Birmingham and Stourbridge was increased to every 10 minutes, which resulted in an increase in service to Kidderminster. As part of the new Stourbridge line timetable, all remaining New Street trains were diverted to Snow Hill. Liverpool to Stansted Airport services started to split at New Street to form two separate services. The Birmingham to Nottingham via Leicester & Derby service was split, and the Leicester to Nottingham service was merged with the hourly Ivanhoe Line service to Loughborough and was extended past Nottingham to Lincoln.
